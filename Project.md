# Call Replier

**Problem statement:**
Quite a number of times have people left their mobile phones untouched due to probably, a busy schedule leaving them with no option than to ingnore calls. In business setting, say a meeting, taking calls would be seen as an ill-mannered act and probably, the receiver could forget about the call after the meeting. This has been a problem and people tend to pick offense for not picking their calls, labelling them to be absurd.

**People affected:**
1. This act affects majorly, those into business whose schedules are always tight, giving them little or no leisure for themselves.
2. It also affects those who could be busy eith things and unavoidable, could not use their mobile phones.

**Probable solution:**
In order not to keep a caller anxious and tensed, one can always device a means of letting the caller know he or she sees the call but could not answer them due to the situation they are in at that moment. 
One of such means is to send a message to the caller immediately after the call ends. This can ve done by creating an array of possible messages that can fit in for different purposes. The application will be designed in such a way that a User can choose the kind of message array suitable for him or her i.e. bussiness replies, personal replies, e.t.c. 
The application can also be designed in such a way that a user can set a time frame for a particular message for calls coming in at that time.

With these options, a caller can always be updated as to why a user cannot receive a call at that moment rather than keeping the caller on suspense, assuming reasons that could not be true.
